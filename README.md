# Inventory Management

A project for Programming on the Cloud which will manage inventory using gRPC

## Installation

Maven should be installed. There is no need to provide any maven goal while generating files from the proto, as a default goal has already been provided in the pom.xml

To test the project, first start the server by running the file **GRPCServer.java** and then run the client.
I have created some sample clients according to specific use cases, which can be found under the package **inventory.client** in **src/main/java**.
